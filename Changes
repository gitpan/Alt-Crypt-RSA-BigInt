  - Add test for h2osp, pss sign and verify with salt.

  - Faster versions of some of the helper functions.

  - Switch from Digest::SHA1 to Digest::SHA, and add SHA256.

  - The following Crypt::RSA 1.99 defects have been fixed or made irrelevant
    due to no longer using Math::Pari:

     RT 52689  consider moving Crypt::RSA to Math::BigInt?
     RT 76655  Version 1.99's META.yml says version is 1.97
     RT 63007  Move to later version of Math-PARI
     RT  4877  Crypt::RSA test 11 fails with a segmentation fault
     RT 61392  Crypt::RSA::Key::Private::check not checking that q is an integer
     RT 64883  Make errstr from check after write more intuitive
     RT 45533  Crypt::RSA bug in mgf1 function

    These fixable possible defects remain, but should be resoved soon.

     RT 69376  Bug in Crypt::RSA::Key::Private::SSH serialize function

    as well as these that aren't clear:

     RT 50356  Crypt-RSA-1.99
     RT 59923  changing the passphrase on key

  - Makefile.PL will look for GMP and Pari, and install the Math::BigInt::GMP
    or Math::BigInt::Pari modules if possible.  It complains otherwise, but
    everything should still work -- it just runs really slow.

  - Completely removed Pari.

  - Replaced modules:

       Crypt::Random  =>  Bytes::Random::Secure
       Crypt::Primes  =>  Math::Prime::Util

  - Started with Vipul's Crypt::RSA.
