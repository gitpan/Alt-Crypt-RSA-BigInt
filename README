NAME
    Alt::Crypt::RSA::BigInt - Rewrite of Crypt::RSA

DESCRIPTION

    This is a rework of Crypt::RSA to remove Math::Pari and instead base
    all operations on Math::BigInt.

STATUS

    This is intended to be a plug-in replacement for Crypt::RSA, with no
    user-visible changes to existing features.

    Math::Pari is completely removed.  This includes the two modules:

       - Crypt::Primes   =>   Math::Prime::Util
       - Crypt::Random   =>   Bytes::Random::Secure

    All operations are now performed using Math::BigInt, and prefer the
    GMP and Pari backends.

    All of the existing bug reports have been addressed, as well as adding
    a few new features such as 

PERFORMANCE

    Performance using GMP is 3-10 times faster than the Crypt::RSA 1.99.

    Using Math::BigInt::Pari, it is about half the speed at signing, and
    on par when verifying.

    If neither GMP nor Pari are available, performance is very slow, from
    10x to 200x slower.  However this is an environment where the original
    code could not run.

    Time to run test suite on my machine:
         4 seconds   with GMP and Math::Prime::Util::GMP
        10 seconds   with GMP
        17 seconds   with Pari (no GMP)
        91 seconds   with Calc (no GMP and no Pari)
    The test suite uses smaller sizes in some tests for non-GMP, non-Pari.
